    The DaphnieMaton is a two-axis system to film continously\n \
    and in a pre-created custom path. Originally made to watch\n \
    for the evolution of a Daphnie population in different tubes\n \
    (testing for temperature), it can be used for all sorts of\n \
    autonomous systemes and can also be mounted with something\n \
    else than a camera.\n \
