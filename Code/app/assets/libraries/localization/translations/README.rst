kniteditor.localization
=======================

This submodule includes the translations.

You can edit them with the `poedit <https://poedit.net/download>`__ software.
The `kniteditor.pot <kniteditor.pot>`__ file is the source of all messages.
The translation files can be updated from it.

If you add a new language, add the folder with the language code and add your language to the po file in the languages folder.
There is a `youtube video <https://youtu.be/9M4y_dUpoeg>`__ on how to add translations.

Additionally, you may want to read the documentation on `readthedocs
<https://kniteditor.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Translate.html>`__ or `pythonhosted
<http://pythonhosted.org/kniteditor/Translate.html>`__.
