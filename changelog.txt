This version is NOT finished, it can be used but some functionalities are not ready yet.

This is a non-exhaustive list of the various problems:
    - The stats shown are not to be considered accurate
    - The represented path does not correspond perfectly to the real one, it is recommended to use 'Direct' mode to be sure of node's position
    - Sometimes a popup saying 'The system has been disconnected' even though it is false
