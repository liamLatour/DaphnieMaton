# DaphnieMaton

The DaphnieMaton is a two-axis system to film continously and in a pre-created custom path.
Originally made to watch for the evolution of a Daphnie population in different tubes (testing for temperature), it can be used for all sorts of autonomous systemes and can also be mounted with something else than a camera.

## Getting Started

- Clone the repo and open "DaphnieMaton.exe"
- Connect the arduino Mega to an usb port and select it under "Port" section in the menu
- Change the designed path to suit your needs
- Click 'update' and voil√† !

### Prerequisites

To build from source you'll need:
  - [Kivy](https://kivy.org/#download)
  - pyserial ```pip install pyserial```

### Building on top

Not implemented yet

## To be added
- Settings:
  - arduino.exe path
  - shortcuts
  - colors
  - default save path
- Ctrl+S so save without reselecting path
- When opened change 'Save' to 'Save as' (remove .json when saving file to avoid .json.json)
