# DaphnieMaton

The DaphnieMaton is a two-axis system to film continously and in a pre-created custom path.
Originally made to watch for the evolution of a Daphnie population in different tubes (testing for temperature), it can be used for all sorts of autonomous systemes and can also be mounted with something else than a camera.
